You wouldn\'t want your perfect team member to be hiding from you, would ya? Didn\'t think so. Don\'t worry, though - we allow you to select that you are not currently hireable, which will warn someone before they try to message you, and keep your current boss off your back.',

Not every piece of information on here is strictly required, but it is all strongly recommended. If you don’t have time to complete the whole thing right now, that’s completely fine! We’ll hold your place for you for the next time you sign in.',
